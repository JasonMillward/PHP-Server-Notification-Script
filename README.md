Server Notification Scripts
-------
This is a small collection of scripts and functions I've made to interact with Twitter and MailGun to alert people hosted on the PartyCat Network as to what is happening with the server in real time.
If the server is under high load, running out of memory or using the database too much it will 'tweet' away letting people know what's going on.
